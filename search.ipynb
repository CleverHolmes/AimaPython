    "Hello!\n",
    "    In this IPython notebook, we study different kinds of search techniques used in [search.py](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search.py) and try to get an intuition of what search algorithms are best suited for various problems. We first explore uninformed search algorithms and later get our hands on heuristic search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code in this IPython notebook, and the entire [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) repository is intended to work with Python 3 (specifically, Python 3.4). So if you happen to be working on Python 2, you should switch to Python 3. For more help on how to install python3, or if you are having other problems, you can always have a look the 'intro' IPython notebook. Now that you have all that sorted out, lets get started!"

It represents the start state from where our agent begins his task of exploration to find the goal state(s) which is given in the `goal` parameter.\n",
    "* `actions(self, state)` : This method returns all the possible actions our agent can make in state `state`.\n",
    "* `result(self, state, action)` : This returns the resulting state if action `action` is taken in the state `state`. This `Problem` class only deals with deterministic outcomes. So we know for sure what every action in a state would result to.\n",
    "* `goal_test(self, state)` : Given a graph state, it checks if it is a terminal state. If the state is indeed a goal state, value of `True` is returned. Else , ofcourse, `False` is returned.\n",
    "* `path_cost(self, c, state1, action, state2)` : Return the cost of the path that arrives at `state2` as a result of taking `action` from `state1`, assuming total cost of `c` to get up to `state1`.\n",

    "Now using the above abstract class as a parent there is another named called `GraphProblem` in our module. It creates a graph problem from an instance of the `Graph` class. To create a graph, simply do `graph = Graph(dict(...))`. The dictionary must contain nodes of the graph as keys, so make sure they are `hashable`. If you don't know what that means just use strings or numbers. Each node in the dictionary should correspond to another dictionary which contain the adjacent nodes as keys and the edge length as its value. The `Graph` class creates a directed(edges allow only one way traffic) by default.If you want to make an undirected graph, use `UndirectedGraph` instead, but make sure to mention any edge in only one of its nodes."

Instead of a `FIFO` queue we use something called a `priority queue` which selects the element with the highest `priority` of all elements in the queue. For our problem lower path cost means higher priority. Whenever we need to enqueue a node already in the queue we update its path cost if the newer path is better. This is a very important step and it means that the path cost to a node may keep getting better until it is selected for expansion. This is the reason that we do a goal check only when a node is selected for expanion."
