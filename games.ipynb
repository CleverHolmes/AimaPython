    "  Hello all!  \n",
    "  In this IPython notebook, I plan to help you a little so that you will be able to use the [games.py](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/games.py) module. You might already know that the `games.py` module implements the algorithms in Chapter 5 (Adversarial Search) of the book 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Before we begin, if you are unsure of how to use the [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) repository or are not familiar with IPython notebooks you should read the [intro notebook](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/intro.ipynb) first.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  What we will do to learn to use the code in this module is simply dive in! I feel this is the correct approach as I assume you must have already read Chapter 5 of AIMA. If you haven't, you might want to go back and do that first. If you are tired (or just lazy), at least read the chapter upto Sec. 5.3 because this module covers the algorithms only till that section anyway. So, I will start by explaining what the class `Game` is and then we will immediately start implementing the `TicTacToe` game. After we define the rules of the `TicTacToe` game, we will create AI players who use different search strategies, namely Minimax Search and Alpha-Beta Search. We will make these players play among themselves, and later on we ourselves will play against these AI players (Yay!).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The reason I chose the `TicTacToe` game for demonstration of this module should be obvious to you. Everyone knows it and has played it, it is analyzed in quite some detail in AIMA, and most importantly, it has comparatively few states (fewer than 362,880) so that we can explore the search tree completely.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  So let's begin."

    "### The class `Game`  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's have a look at the class `Game` in our module. We see that it has six functions, namely `actions`, `result`, `utility`, `terminal_test`, `to_move` and `display`. We see that these functions have not actually been implemented. This class is actually just a template class; we are supposed to create the class for our game, `TicTacToe` by inheriting this `Game` class and implement all the methods mentioned in `Game`. If you forget to implement any one of those, a `NotImplementedError` will be raised. So, in this sense, the `Game` class is what you might call an abstract class in Java: it implements nothing, just tells you all that you are supposed to implement and screams at you if forget to implement what it asks.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now let's get into some details of all these methods in our `Game` class. You have to implement these methods when you create the new class that would represent your game.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* `__init__(self, <other variables>)` :  When you create a class inherited from the `Game` class (class `TicTacToe` in our case), you'll have to create an object of this inherited class to initialize the game. This initialization might require some additional information which would be passed to `__init__` as variables. For the case of our `TicTacToe` game, this additional information would be the number of rows `h`, number of columns `v` and how many consecutive X's or O's are needed in a row, column or diagonal for a win `k`. Also, the initial game state has to be defined here in `__init__`.\n",
    "* `actions(self, state)` : Given a game state, this method should generates all the legal actions possible from this state, as a list or a generator. Returning a generator rather than a list has the advantage that it saves space and you can still operate on it as a list.\n",
    "* `result(self, state, move)` : Given a game state and a move, this method returns the game state that you get by making that move on this game state.\n",
    "* `utility(self, state, player)` : Given a terminal game state and a player, this method returns the utility for that player in the given terminal game state. While implementing this method assume that the game state is a terminal game state. The logic in this module is such that this method will be called only on terminal game states.\n",
    "* `terminal_test(self, state)` : Given a game state, this method should return `True` if this game state is a terminal state, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `to_move(self, state)` : Given a game state, this method returns the player who is to play next. This information is typically stored in the game state, so all this method does is extract this information and return it."

    "### Deciding the game state representation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now, before we start implementing our `TicTacToe` game, we need to decide how we will be representing our game state. Typically, a game state will give you all the current information about the game at any point in time. Yes, all of it. When you are given a game state, you should be able to tell whose turn it is next, how the game will look like on a real-life board (if it has one) etc. A game state need not include the history of the game. If you can play the game further given a game state, you game state representation is acceptable. While we might like to include all kinds of information in our game state, we wouldn't want to put too much information into it. Modifying this game state to generate a new one would be a real pain then.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now, as for our `TicTacToe` game state, would storing only the positions of all the X's and O's be sufficient to represent all the game information at that point in time? Well, does it tell us whose turn it is next? Looking at the 'X's and O's on the board and counting them should tell us that. But that would mean extra computing. To avoid this, we will also store whose move it is next in the game state.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Think about what we've done here. We have reduced extra computation by storing additional information in a game state. Now, this information might not be absolutely essential to tell us about the state of the game, but it does save us additional computation time. We'll do more of this later on.  \n",

Storing this utility is a good idea, because, when you do a Minimax Search or an Alphabeta Search, you generate many recursive calls, which travel all the way down to the terminal states. When these recursive calls go back up to the original callee, we have calculated utilities for many game states. We store these utilities in their respective `GameState`s to avoid calculating them all over again.\n",
